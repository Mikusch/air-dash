# Team Fortress 2 All-Class Air Dash

This is a simple plugin that allows all classes to perform an air dash. It can be enabled or disabled with the ConVar `tf_all_classes_can_air_dash ( def. "1" )`.

While I'm sure this has been done before, this implementation respects all ConVars, attributes and conditions related to air dashing.

## Dependencies

* SourceMod 1.10
* [MemoryPatch](https://github.com/Kenzzer/MemoryPatch) (compile only)

This is a simple plugin that allows all classes to perform an air dash. It can be enabled or disabled with the ConVar `tf_all_classes_can_air_dash`.

This implementation respects all ConVars, attributes and conditions related to air dashing.

Your server needs [DHooks with Detour Support](https://github.com/peace-maker/DHooks2) to use this.
